# DNXRoboto_Font
A variant of ROBOTO font, with glyphs for gamepad controls.

# Overview

I decided to modify the original ROBOTO font, adding some glyphs for representing each control of standard Gamepad, including press and hold states.
These glyphs are assigned to slots without standard spanish/english characters.
The rest of the glyphs are untouched so you can use this a standard Roboto font.
