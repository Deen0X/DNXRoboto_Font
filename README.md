# DNXRoboto_Font
A variant of ROBOTO font, with glyphs for gamepad controls.

# Overview

I decided to modify the original ROBOTO font, adding some glyphs for representing each control of standard Gamepad, including press and hold states.
These glyphs are assigned to slots without standard spanish/english characters.
The rest of the glyphs are untouched so you can use this a standard Roboto font.

I used the [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) tool for edit the source font and creating the new glyph set.

# Update 4.4.1

Fonts recreated from scratch, taking again the Roboto font as base, and using PUA (Private Use Area, starting from E000) for encoding the new glyphs. This way i did not touch any of the original glyphs.

Now the glyphs are divided into groups, for better usage and maintenance.

Some minor bugs fixed

Added miscelaneous glyphs related to gaming.

# Unicodes

Now, start from E000 for special glyphs used as base for another glyphs.
